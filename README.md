Computer vision powered supply chains so stakeholders can efficiently manage resources. This will help with increasing food yields, reducing water use, and decreasing global green house gas emissions.

1) 70% of freshwater withdrawals from agriculture 
2) 2) Deforestation from agriculture leads to desertification, soil erosion, fewer crops 
3) 3) Agriculture yields, biodiversity, and meet food production demands
